Changelog for ZokumBSP

ZokumBSP 1.0.8-rc2
- Using 64bit uints in reject cde to stop it crashing on large maps. This
  fixed building a reject table on a 2k sector map. Bigger maps still crash
  in a different location.

ZokumBSP 1.0.8-rc1
- Anotak found a nice optimization, moved checks out of a core loop. This 
  gives a 33% speedup.

ZokumBSP 1.0.7-rc2
- Many minor cleanups of the Git repo.
- Anotak added Visual Studio tweaks to make it compile.

ZokumBSP 1.0.7-rc1
- Preprocessing is now done in a seperate step, and data can be used by reject
  and nodes structures if needed.
- New format for the changelog.txt, should be easier to read.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6 (Choose your own offset adventure)
- No changes from rc2.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6-rc2
- Added support for detecting BOOM generalized linedefs and extended linedefs.
- Limited support for a 32bit BLOCKMAP format.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6-rc1
- Use -bo=x,y to specify a specific offset, useful for special effects.
- LoadHexenInfo in level.cpp now checks if the sscanf matches anything. 

ZokumBSP 1.0.5 (Boundary box discarding)
- No changes from rc3

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc3
- Fixed several memory leaks.

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc2
- Distributed prebuilt windows version is built static. No dlls needed.

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc1
- Discards looking blocks farther away than the longest linedef in a block.

ZokumBSP 1.0.4 (Argument cleanup and a bit of heuristics)
- Added new heuristic approach to reduce brute force solution space.
- Changed command line arguments to be easier and more foolproof.

ZokumBSP 1.0.3 (Sub block improvement release)
- All non id-compatibe blockmaps are now 2 bytes smaller.
- No longer assumes 2s flag means a linedef is two-sided.

ZokumBSP 1.0.2  (Speed improvements)
- Sorted blocks allow for quicker generation / comparisons.
- Minor enhancements. Better sorting algorithm from stdlib.
- HTML output switch.
- HTML output is now usable.
- Massive speed improvements.
- Reformatted help screen.
- Fixed a ZenNode bug when an invalid wad file is specified.

ZokumBSP 1.0.1 (Released as closed source for testing)
- Compiles on windows vis MinGW.
- Id blockmap header now optional
- Support for 8x8 id offset.
- Can generate id-compatible smaller blockmaps.
- Support for tag 999 never blocking lines.
- Algorithm for finding never blocking lines.
- Option: Find sub block lists to improve blockmap size.

ZokumBSP 1.0.0 (Initial test release)
- Added brute force 128*128 origin.
