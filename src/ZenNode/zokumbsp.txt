Description
===========

ZokumBSP is an advanced node/blockmap builder for Doom / Doom 2. Based on
ZenNode 1.2.0 and available from GitHub.

This is a work in progress and is a very experimental node builder.
Proeject goals

A node / blockmap / reject builder that allows for larger maps that are
compatible with the classic Doom dos executables and with the Chocolate Doom
project.

Compability
===========

It can produce compressed blockmaps that are compatible with the original Id
Software blockmaps that should ensure 100% demo playback compability. It can
also produce blockmaps that are compatible with ZenNode 1.2.0 and BSP
blockmaps, but with a possibly smaller size.

The Blockmap in the original 'vanilla' Doom dos executables have an upper
limit of about 65 kilobyte. Bigger blockmaps would lead to the game crashing,
putting an upper limit on the complexity and size of the maps one can create.

By using better algorithms, some tricks and the added option of brute force
testing up to 65k different blockmap offsets one can generate blockmaps that
are significantly smaller than what was possible with ZenNode, BSP or Id's
original node builder.

Use the -bi+ switch to build blockmaps that can replace the original
blockmaps. The quality of compability has been tested mostly with multiple
compet-n demos of multilevel recordings. Primarily 30nm2039.lmp, 30ns6155.lmp
and 30famax2.lmp
