ZokumBSP 1.0.5
==============

This is the directory tree with all the files needed to build ZokumBSP from
source. 

The code is a fork of the GPLed ZenNode, and is thus also a GPL project with
the same license as ZenNode 1.2.0.

The executables produced are currently slot-in compatible with ZenNode. This
allows you to replace your ZenNode executable in your current setup to test 
this setup. The default behaviour is fairly conservative and fairly similar
to the behaviour an output of ZenNode, but usually producing smaller 
blockmaps.

There is a fair bit of cruft and things in need of cleanup in this project.
This is due to the slightly experimental nature of this project and that the 
original ZenNode code also has unused and problematic code.

The main focus of this release is to produce a node/blockmap/reject builder
that alows for the production of big maps that are compatible with the 
original dos based doom executables and the chocolate doom project.

There might be some features that are handled badly by some Doom ports that
deviate from the classic behaviour. The output of this code has mainly
been tested with Chocolate Doom.

For more information about the original project that this fork is based on,
see the README-ZenNode.
