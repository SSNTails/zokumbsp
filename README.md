## Description

ZokumBSP is an advanced node/blockmap builder for Doom / Doom 2.
It should also build Heretic and Hexen maps, but this is untested.
Based on ZenNode 1.2.0 and available from GitHub.

This is a work in progress and is an experimental node builder.

## Proeject goals

A node / blockmap / reject builder that allows for larger maps that
are compatible with the classic Doom dos executables and with the 
Chocolate Doom project.

## Compability

It can produce compressed blockmaps that are compatible with the 
original Id Software blockmaps that should ensure 100% demo playback
compability. It can also produce blockmaps that are compatible with
ZenNode 1.2.0 and BSP blockmaps, but with a possibly smaller size.

The Blockmap in the original 'vanilla' Doom dos executables have an
upper limit of about 65 kilobyte. Bigger blockmaps would lead to the
game crashing, putting an upper limit on the complexity and size of
the maps one can create.

By using better algorithms, some tricks and the added option of 
brute force testing up to 65k different blockmap offsets one can
generate blockmaps that are significantly smaller than what was
possible with ZenNode, BSP or Id's original node builder.

Use the -bi+ switch to build blockmaps that can replace the 
original blockmaps. The quality of compability has been tested
mostly with multiple compet-n demos of multilevel recordings. 
Primarily 30nm2039.lmp, 30ns6155.lmp and 30famax2.lmp
