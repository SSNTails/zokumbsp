    <h2>Background</h2>

    <div class="boxtext">
      <p>After playing around with a few level editors for DOOM, I noticed that most of them took a long time to build the NODES structure. Even worse, some of them built NODES that didn't work! So, I decided I'd try writing a NODES builder that 1) built valid NODES and 2) built them FAST. Well, after a month or two of fooling around, ZenNode is here. I believe both objectives have been reached. I've compared it to several other NODES builders out there and it blows them all away! It's written entirely in C/C++. It could probably be sped up with a little assembly code (or a better optimizing compiler).</p>
      <p>The .zip file contains a fully functional BLOCKMAP, NODES, and REJECT builder for DOOM .WAD files. ZenNode will rebuild either a single level or all the levels in a .WAD file. ZenNode will accept either DOOM, DOOM II, Heretic, and/or HEXEN .WADs. Try it out. Let me know what you think.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <div class="boxtext">
      <p>ZenNode will read the level description from a .WAD file and create either a new BLOCKMAP resource, REJECT resource, and/or NODES/SEGS/SSECTOR resources. Levels in a .WAD may be specified on the command line, or, if none are specified, all of the maps in a .WAD will be rebuilt.</p>
      <p>As it completes a resource, ZenNode will print information indicating the results. When a BLOCKMAP is completed, it will display the new/old size of the block map and a percentage of the block map that is actually used by the map. After it rebuilds the BSP tree, it will display the number of new/old NODES and SEGS that it created along with the original numbers. For the REJECT resource, it displays the new and old efficiencies (higher numbers mean less work for the game engine at run time).

      <p>I've tested the .WADs generated by ZenNode and haven't found any fatal or HOM (Hall-of-mirrors) side effects from any level I've tested. However, by using this program you assume all responsibility for lost/damaged files resulting from the use of a .WAD generated by ZenNode. If you find a level that causes either an error in ZenNode, HOMs, or any other problem inside DOOM, DOOM II, Heretic, or Hexen please let <a href="mailto:zennode@mrousseau.org">me</a> know.
